# Free--Dictionary-API
I came across an inspiring free Dictionary API created. however, with my initiative i was able to build a Dictionary APl that can be used at your comfort zone. 

NOTE: make sure your internet connection is 100% active when using the Dictionary API, though some words are limited from showing because of how it's been built by the creator.
you can check out the API if you'd love to review more about the project. will be looking forward for any correction on the project from the community.
