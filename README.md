## Free Dictionary API

I came across an inspiring free Dictionary API created. however, with my initiative i was able to build a Dictionary APl that can be used at your comfort zone.
furthermore, the framework of my program includes vocal of any key been searched on the dictionary, key and meaning that are been fletched from the dictionary-api.moreover, it can be very useful in the community and can be compatible with anyone who find it hard to operate a computer eg.kids,computer illterate and can be used at your own 
convenience.

In Summary, my main aim of creating this project was to sharpen my skills on javascript on how to handle large amount of data-set with dictionary-api as a module.
NOTE: surely your Internet connection should be 100% active when running the program to be able to access the data from the API and you can always check It out to review more about the project. 
I'll also be working with the community in a way to make it easier for people who want it easier for us and the service providers to access the information from our customers in a timely fashion so they don't get the wrong impression and can easily get a response to it without any delay or any additional issues or problems that may be arise from the other service providers. üôè looking forward for any feedback from the project team Thanks!
