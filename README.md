KidiIT-patch-1
I came across an inspiring free Dictionary API created. however, with my initiative i was able to build a Dictionary APl that can be used at your comfort zone. 

NOTE: make sure your internet connection is 100% active when using the Dictionary API, though some words are limited from showing because of how it's been built by the creator.
you can check out the API if you'd love to review more about the project. will be looking forward for any correction on the project from the community.

furthermore,the framework of my program includes vocal of any key been searched on the dictionary, key and meaning that are been fletched from the dictionary-api.moreover, it can be very useful in the community and can be compatible with anyone who find it hard to operate a computer eg.kids,computer illterate and can be used at your own 
convenience.
in summary, my main aim of creating this project was to sharpen my skills on javascript on how to handle large amount of data-set with dictionary-api as a module.
